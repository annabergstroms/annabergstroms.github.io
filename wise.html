            <h3>Summary and Challenge</h3>
            <p>In recent years, more and more young adults have struggled with managing their finances, particularly saving, despite the availability of finance apps. Most young adults don’t have large savings or the ability to save large sums; instead, they save smaller amounts regularly. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For my master's thesis, I developed Wise, a personal finance management app designed to meet the needs and preferences of young adults. I conducted a competitive analysis and semi-structured interviews with the target group. Using the interview data, I created a prototype, which was then tested and refined based on user feedback.

<h2>1 Research</h2>
<h3>Competitive Research</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Three existing personal finance apps were analyzed which allowed me to understand how other similar services have designed their applications and what interactions and features they have. In addition, the analysis made me understand what is missing on the market, what can be improved and what I should strive to maintain.

<h3>Interviews</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Seven interviews were conducted to gain deep understanding of how the target group manages their finances and their behaviors and attitudes toward personal finances. Broad and open-ended questions were formulated to collect qualitative data and a pilot interview was conducted to test the questions' feasibility and identify and work out any problems. As the target group for this study was women and men aged 18-25, it was important that the participants were within this age range. In order to achieve a result that is more reliable, the goal was to have participants in different ages within the age range, as well as gender and occupation.

<h3>Thematic Analysis</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>To analyze the data from the interviews, I performed a thematic analysis. The thematic analysis was a way of categorizing the data to identify similarities, differences, frequencies, sequences, correspondences and causations. Through the analysis, I gained insights into the target group and their needs.

        <h4>Insights</h4>
        <p>- Users have used various techniques to take control and save money but these have been too time-consuming and ineffective.</p>
        <p>- Users lack interest, which makes it difficult to take control of personal finances.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box-right">
        <h4>Needs</h4>
        <p>- Users need to be motivated to take control of their personal finances and save money.</p>
        <p>- Users need to become aware of their purchasing behaviour.</p>
        <p>- Users need something concrete to save money.</p>

<h2>2 Design & Prototype</h2>
<h3>Prototype</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Based on the insights and needs, the focus was on making the prototype easy and fun. The users should get a clear overview of their purchasing behavior, which can create an awareness of which category they can reduce their spending. Users can set savings goals as it becomes concrete why they are saving money. Different gamification elements were integrated to increase the motivation of the users.
