                    <h3>Summary and Challenge</h3>
                    <p>In recent years, more and more young adults have struggled with managing their finances, particularly saving, despite the availability of finance apps. Most young adults don’t have large savings or the ability to save large sums; instead, they save smaller amounts regularly. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For my master's thesis, I developed Wise, a personal finance management app designed to meet the needs and preferences of young adults. I conducted a competitive analysis and semi-structured interviews with the target group. Using the interview data, I created a prototype, which was then tested and refined based on user feedback.

<h2>1 Research</h2>
<h3>Competitive Research</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Three existing personal finance apps were analyzed which allowed me to understand how other similar services have designed their applications and what interactions and features they have. In addition, the analysis made me understand what is missing on the market, what can be improved and what I should strive to maintain.

</div>

<h3>Interviews</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Seven interviews were conducted to gain deep understanding of how the target group manages their finances and their behaviors and attitudes toward personal finances. Broad and open-ended questions were formulated to collect qualitative data and a pilot interview was conducted to test the questions' feasibility and identify and work out any problems. As the target group for this study was women and men aged 18-25, it was important that the participants were within this age range. In order to achieve a result that is more reliable, the goal was to have participants in different ages within the age range, as well as gender and occupation.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Thematic Analysis</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>To analyze the data from the interviews, I performed a thematic analysis. The thematic analysis was a way of categorizing the data to identify similarities, differences, frequencies, sequences, correspondences and causations. Through the analysis, I gained insights into the target group and their needs.

<div class="shadow-box">
    <div class="text-box-left">
        <h4>Insights</h4>
        <p>- Users have used various techniques to take control and save money but these have been too time-consuming and ineffective.</p>
        <p>- Users lack interest, which makes it difficult to take control of personal finances.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box-right">
        <h4>Needs</h4>
        <p>- Users need to be motivated to take control of their personal finances and save money.</p>
        <p>- Users need to become aware of their purchasing behaviour.</p>
        <p>- Users need something concrete to save money.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>2 Design & Prototype</h2>
<h3>Prototype</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Based on the insights and needs, the focus was on making the prototype easy and fun. The users should get a clear overview of their purchasing behavior, which can create an awareness of which category they can reduce their spending. Users can set savings goals as it becomes concrete why they are saving money. Different gamification elements were integrated to increase the motivation of the users.

<h2>3 Test</h2>
<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Ten usability tests were performed to understand how the prototype was experienced. I wrote a usability testing plan to define what and why I want to test and get prepared for the test. The think-aloud method was used during the tests, which meant that the participants told out loud what they were doing, thinking and feeling when they interacted with the prototype. Each session ended with an shorter interview to follow up and complete the usability tests.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Thematic Analysis</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>To analyze the data from the usability tests, I did a thematic analysis. The thematic analysis was a way to identify patterns and frustrations as participants interacted with the prototype, and identify areas for improvement.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="shadow-box2">
    <div class="patterns">
        <h4>Patterns</h4>
        <p>- 8/10 Users understood that the pie chart icons are clickable</p>
        <p>- 8/10 Users did not understand step two of the savings goal creation</p>
        <p>- 10/10 Users found it easy to understand how to transfer money to savings goals</p>
    </div>
    <div class="insights">
        <h4>Insights</h4>
        <p>- Light mode leads to better performance most of the time</p>
        <p>- Users feel that the colors and icons make the app more appealing and make it easier to navigate between the numbers</p>
    </div>
    <div class="recommendations">
        <h4>Recommendations</h4>
        <p>- Clearer buttons to see more details about expenses and income</p>
        <p>- Savings should be included as an expense</p>
        <p>- Change the back button to a back arrow</p>
    </div>

<h2>Result</h2>
<h3>Interactive Prototype</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Data from usability tests were taken into account when iterating the prototype. The next step would be to perform new usability tests with this prototype and develop it further.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>This project was an independent work, which was educational and rewarding. I have gained more confidence in my UX and UI skills. Furthermore, I developed my skills in usability testing.
