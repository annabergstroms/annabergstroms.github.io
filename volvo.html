        <h3>Summary and Challenge</h3>
        <p>Volvo Cars' development teams have multiple sources of quality information, but lacked an efficient solution that brings this information together in a meaningful way. The challenge was to provide a user-friendly platform for the teams to access and act on their quality  information. To address this, we designed and developed the Team Product Quality Dashboard, based on user research, design, feedback, and iteration.
            <br>
            <br>
            The dashboard delivers a comprehensive overview and actionable insights, allowing teams to quickly identify, prioritize, and respond to the quality information. It is team-based and customizable, enabling each team to adapt it to their specific needs. The solution received strong positive feedback from both developers and management, confirming its value in streamlining quality management.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the project was internal to Volvo Cars, some aspects of the process and prototype cannot be shared.

<h2>1 Research</h2>
<h3>User Interviews</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Based on 11 user interviews with developers from different development teams at the company, we identified key user needs and problems that we needed to solve to make it easier for developers to get an overview of their quality information and other relevant information and data.
