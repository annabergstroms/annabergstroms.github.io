            <h3>Summary and Challenge</h3>
            <p>There is a growing number of parents moving to Sweden, as well as a growing number of single parents, who lack community and support in social networking sites. Massika has collected data and identified a need to form a social networking site to create a sense of community for parents.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Massika was a school project conducted on behalf of Emilie Afchar, the founder of Massika, in collaboration with Södertörn University. Our project challenge was to develop an interactive, mobile-optimized prototype for Massika, designed to help parents communicate, exchange advice, share experiences, and meet others in similar situations. To design the prototype, we created a sitemap and user flow diagrams and iterated the design through usability tests and interviews with the target group. The project received positive feedback from both our teachers and Massika, who expressed interest in further development and collaboration.

<h2>1 Research</h2>
<h3>Stakeholder Interview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>The project began with a kick-off meeting with our stakeholder Emilie Afchar. She gave us insights into Massika's vision and idea, and her expectations for the collaboration. It quickly became apparent that there was a clear idea of ​​the platform we were going to design including pages and features, but that it was quite open to development and improvement. We created a project plan where we mapped out the project, such as background, goals, constraints, requirements specifications, situational analysis and timetable.
    </p>
</div>

<br>

<h3>Competitive Research</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Three existing competitors to Massika were analyzed, which allowed us to understand how other similar services have designed their applications and what interactions and functions they have. In addition, the analysis made us understand what is missing in the market, what can be improved and what we should strive to maintain.

<br>
<br>

<h3>Analysis of User Interviews</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Before starting the project, the stakeholder had already collected user data through interviews. The existing data by the stakeholder was analyzed through thematic analysis. This allowed us to understand users' opinions and preferences, how they may differ or be similar, and to find interesting perspectives to work with during the project. Furthermore, it became clearer what pages and features the platform should contain.

</div>

<br>
<br>

<h3>Personas</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>We visualized the key findings from the collected data through personas. We created two personas, Felicity and Kim. They represent different parts of the target group to better understand different types of users. The personas helped us to better understand who the users are, their needs, wants, and frustrations.

<h2>2 Develop</h2>
<h3>Sitemap</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>After outlining the main pages from previous data collection, we needed to organize the pages in the app. This was done through a sitemap, which helped us to visually understand the structure, relationships and connections between pages, as well as the navigation paths on the platform.
    <br>
    <br>
    As shown in the sitemap, the main pages (news feed, explore, community, calendar and profile) are the starting points of the sitemap where there is a top-down hierarchy showing how the different pages are connected to each other. The home page is the community page as it has the most features, has links to the other pages and has the main functions of the platform.

    </div>
</div>

<br>
<br>

<h3>User Flow</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>To understand how users will navigate and interact on the platform, we created user flows. By segmenting the main pages and imagining a typical user's journey, we streamlined the user experience, identifying and eliminating unnecessary steps for more efficient interactions. Seven user flows were created but here is one key flow.

    </div>
</div>

<br>
<br>

<h3>Requirement Specification</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Our research and analysis resulted in a requirements specification. This was done by writing down both high-level requirements and low-level requirements to help bridge the gap between the problem and the solution. The requirements guided us further in the design process and the creation of the prototype.

<h2>3 Prototype & Test</h2>
<h3>Prototype</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>The prototype was designed based on the requirement specification. During this time, I was involved in designing the Community and Calendar pages.

<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Eight usability tests with parents of different ages were conducted. We started by performing a pilot test to ensure the feasibility of the scenarios and questions that would be included in the tests. During the tests, think-aloud was used, which meant that the participants told out loud what they were doing and what they were thinking when they interacted with the prototype. This gave us deeper insights into the participants' mental process as they performed the tests, for example, what was easier and more challenging for them to do, and what surprised or frustrated them.
    </p>
</div>

<br>

<h3>Analysis of Usability Testing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>To analyze the data from the usability tests, we did a thematic analysis. The analysis was a way to identify areas of improvement in the prototype.
    </p>

    </div>
</div>

<br>
<br>

<h3>Requirement Specification</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>We designed a new requirements specification, which was based on the results of the usability tests. The requirements specification was helpful and served as a foundation as we iterated the prototype.
    </p>
</div>

</div>

<br>
<br>

<h2>Result</h2>
<h3>Interactive Prototype</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>The requirement specification was the basis when the prototype was iterated. I spent a lot of time working on the placement of design elements and color treatment. Furthermore, I was also heavily involved in designing the Explore and Calendar page.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Working on this project taught me the importance of communication between us designers and also with the stakeholder who had no experience in design. Furthermore, it was instructive to analyze data that someone else has collected. Finally, I learned how to work with user testing to create a user-centered design solution. At the end I was so excited about it that all I wanted was to continue working on it.
