            <h3>Summary and Challenge</h3>
            <p>There is a growing number of parents moving to Sweden, as well as a growing number of single parents, who lack community and support in social networking sites. Massika has collected data and identified a need to form a social networking site to create a sense of community for parents.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Massika was a school project conducted on behalf of Emilie Afchar, the founder of Massika, in collaboration with Södertörn University. Our project challenge was to develop an interactive, mobile-optimized prototype for Massika, designed to help parents communicate, exchange advice, share experiences, and meet others in similar situations. To design the prototype, we created a sitemap and user flow diagrams and iterated the design through usability tests and interviews with the target group. The project received positive feedback from both our teachers and Massika, who expressed interest in further development and collaboration.

<h2>1 Research</h2>
<h3>Stakeholder Interview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>The project began with a kick-off meeting with our stakeholder Emilie Afchar. She gave us insights into Massika's vision and idea, and her expectations for the collaboration. It quickly became apparent that there was a clear idea of ​​the platform we were going to design including pages and features, but that it was quite open to development and improvement. We created a project plan where we mapped out the project, such as background, goals, constraints, requirements specifications, situational analysis and timetable.
    </p>
</div>

<br>

<h3>Competitive Research</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Three existing competitors to Massika were analyzed, which allowed us to understand how other similar services have designed their applications and what interactions and functions they have. In addition, the analysis made us understand what is missing in the market, what can be improved and what we should strive to maintain.

<h3>Analysis of User Interviews</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Before starting the project, the stakeholder had already collected user data through interviews. The existing data by the stakeholder was analyzed through thematic analysis. This allowed us to understand users' opinions and preferences, how they may differ or be similar, and to find interesting perspectives to work with during the project. Furthermore, it became clearer what pages and features the platform should contain.

<h3>Personas</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>We visualized the key findings from the collected data through personas. We created two personas, Felicity and Kim. They represent different parts of the target group to better understand different types of users. The personas helped us to better understand who the users are, their needs, wants, and frustrations.
